# Z-Loading-Screen

This loading screen is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements, allowing for great flexibility in terms of design and customization. The code includes a set of default messages that are displayed in the center of the screen and are automatically changed every 10 seconds. These messages can be easily edited and replaced to suit specific needs. This can be done equally with the wallpapers.
